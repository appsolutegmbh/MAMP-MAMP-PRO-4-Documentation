## Cloud

### What is MAMP Cloud?

MAMP Cloud functions provide an easy way to make backups of your hosts (host files and associated database(s)), or faciliate code sharing between two Pc's, or PC and Mac.

#### Backups

Make backups of your hosts by pressing the "Save To" button on the Cloud tab of your host. To retrieve a previously made backup, press the "Load From" button. MAMP PRO saves the host files and associated database of the host in the cloud. 

#### Code Sharing

Use the MAMP PRO Cloud Functions to share code between two machines, Macintosh or PC. On one machine you can "Save To", sending your host data to the cloud. On a separate machine you can pick up where you left off. Press the "Load From" button and your cloud data will uploaded to your machine.

Use this [quick start guide](../First-Steps/Save-To-Cloud) to get up and running using Cloud Functions.
