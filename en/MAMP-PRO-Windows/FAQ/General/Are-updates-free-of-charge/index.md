## FAQ - General

### Are updates free of charge?

Yes, all updates in the current major version (4.x) are free of charge. To update MAMP PRO from e.g. 4.1.2 to 4.9 just use the serial number you already have. Licenses are good forever, they are not on a subscription basis. MAMP PRO 3 Windows licenses are also valid for MAMP PRO 4 Windows.
