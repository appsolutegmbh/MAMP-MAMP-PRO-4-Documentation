## First Steps > Add Additional Host

To add an additional host press the '+' button at the bottom left corner of the Hosts table. You can create a simple host by adding a host name and document root. 

<div class="alert" role="alert">
Note: Do not create document root folders under your "C:\MAMP" folder. A better location for your document root folders would be "C:\Users\MyUserName\Sites" or "C:\Users\MyUserName\WebSites". When you do this, your host data is separated from the MAMP PRO application data. 
</div>

Additionally you can add a database, or move files over from a previously built template folder. See the [Hosts](../../Settings/Hosts/General) section for more information on what a host is and how to create additional hosts.
