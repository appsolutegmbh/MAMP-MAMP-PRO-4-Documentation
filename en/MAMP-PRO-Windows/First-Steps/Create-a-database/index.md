## First Steps > Create A Database

A second additional option when creating a new host is the "Create a database" checkbox. This will add a database associated with your new host. A new database will be created for the "root" MySQL user. This database will be associated with your host which can be confirmed on the [Settings > Hosts > Databases](/en/MAMP-PRO-Windows/Settings/Hosts/Databases/) tab.
