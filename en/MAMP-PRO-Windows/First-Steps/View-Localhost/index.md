## First Steps > View Localhost

Your default host for MAMP PRO is "localhost". The files for localhost are initially located in the "C:\MAMP\htdocs" folder. Press "Open" located to the right of the "Host Name" text box to open up the localhost in a web browser.

If you are upgrading from MAMP Free, and you used several sub folders under "C:\MAMP\htdocs" to create several hosts, you then need to check the "index" checkbox to see you directory structure of "C:\MAMP\htdocs". Check this checkbox, restart your servers and you will see your directory structure.

Note: Although the default localhost document root is located in "C:\MAMP\htdocs", it is best to keep it's document root, and the document root of additional hosts out of the "C:\MAMP" folder. A better directory structure for your host document root folders would be "C:\Users\MyUserName\Documents\Sites\localhost", "C:\Users\MyUserName\Documents\Sites\site1", "C:\Users\MyUserName\Documents\Sites\site2", etc ... .
